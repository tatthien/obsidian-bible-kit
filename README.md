# Obsidian Study for Vietnamese

This plugin aims to make Bible study easier and more productive for Vietnamese Christians (or anyone who is using Bible in Vietnamese). The motivation behind this plugin is that I couldn't find any plugins supporting Vietnamese Bible translations.

## Installation

### Using BRAT

1. Install [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) from the Community Plugins in Obsidian
2. Open the command palette and run **BRAT: Add a beta plugin for testing**
3. Paste this repository URL: `https://github.com/tatthien/obsidian-bible-kit`
4. Click **Add Plugin**
5. In Settings > Community Plugins, refresh the list and enable **Bible Study for Vietnamese**

## Features

- Embed scriptures into your Obsidian notes using Obsidian Editor's suggestion feature. For example, you can write `--gi 3:16` and the plugin will automatically suggest `Giăng 3:16`. For more information about the book abbreviations, see [this documentation](./docs/BOOK_ABBREVIATION.md).
