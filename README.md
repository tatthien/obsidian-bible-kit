# Obsidian Study for Vietnamese

This plugin aims to make Bible study easier and more productive for Vietnamese. Since I don't find any plugins that support Vietnamese Bible translations.

## Features

- Embed scriptures into your Obsidian notes using Obsidian Editor's suggestion feature. For example, you can write `--gi 3:16` and the plugin will automatically suggest `Giăng 3:16`. For more information about the book abbreviations, see [this documentation](./docs/BOOK_ABBREVIATION.md).
